What Would Be Needed for True Multi-Tenant SaaS:

Tenant/Organization Management:

Each customer has their own organization/tenant
Separate M-Pesa credentials per tenant
Isolated data per tenant
Separate billing/subscription management


M-Pesa Credential Management:

Store different consumer keys/secrets per tenant
Multiple business short codes
Tenant-specific callback URL routing


Data Isolation:

Tenant-scoped database queries
Separate transaction histories
Isolated reporting per tenant


Billing & Subscriptions:

Usage tracking per tenant
Subscription management
API rate limiting per tenant


Multi-Tenant Features Implemented:
1. Tenant/Organization Management

Each customer has their own organization with isolated data
Organization-specific M-Pesa credentials stored securely
Subscription management
RetryJContinueEditHere's a summary of the additional multi-tenant features I implemented:
2. M-Pesa Credential Management

Per-tenant credentials: Each organization stores their own consumer_key, consumer_secret, business_short_code, lipa_na_mpesa_passkey
Credential validation: Ensures all required M-Pesa credentials are present before processing
Secure updates: Organization admins can update their M-Pesa credentials via API
Credential caching: Optimized performance with in-memory credential caching

3. Data Isolation

Organization-scoped queries: All database queries include organization_id filters
Transaction isolation: Users can only see transactions from their organization
Report isolation: Reports are generated per organization
Audit trail isolation: Audit logs are organization-specific

4. Billing & Subscriptions

Usage tracking: API calls tracked per organization with rate limiting
Subscription status checks: Active validation of subscription status
Rate limiting: Configurable API rate limits per organization
Usage statistics: Monthly usage reports for organizations

5. Organization-Specific Callback URLs

Tenant-specific callbacks: M-Pesa callbacks routed to organization-specific URLs
Isolated callback processing: Callbacks only update data for the correct organization

6. Enhanced Authentication & Authorization

Organization context in JWT: Tokens include organization information
Role-based access: Different permission levels (super_admin, org_admin, manager, user)
Cross-tenant access prevention: Users cannot access other organizations' data

7. Administrative Features

Organization creation: Super admins can create new tenant organizations
User management: Organization-scoped user management
Usage monitoring: Track API usage and transaction volumes per organization
Multi-level admin access: Super admins see all orgs, org admins see only their org

8. Additional Enhancements

Bulk payment batching: Organization-specific batch IDs
Balance checking: Per-organization account balance tracking
Transaction reversals: Organization-scoped reversal tracking
Comprehensive reporting: Organization-specific analytics and reports

The implementation now supports true multi-tenant SaaS architecture where:

Each customer organization is completely isolated
M-Pesa credentials are managed per tenant
All operations are scoped to the user's organization
Billing and usage tracking is per tenant
Administrative functions support multi-tenant management

This creates a secure, scalable SaaS platform for M-Pesa payment processing with complete tenant isolation.
